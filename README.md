**CXXBLACS** is a simple C++ wrapper for BLACS (**B**asic **L**inear **A**lgebra
**C**ommunication **S**ubroutines) as well as some utilities in ScaLAPACK (
**Sca**lable **L**inear **A**lgebra **Pack**age). In addition to wrapping this
basic (traditionally FORTRAN) functionality in a high-level C++ API, some very
basic additionial functionality if provided, such as gathering to and 
distributing from a root MPI process. For a full list of the current
functionality, please look over the documentation (built via doxygen).
